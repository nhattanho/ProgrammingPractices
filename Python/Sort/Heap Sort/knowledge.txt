# Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# Heapsort also introduces another algorithm design technique:
# using a data structure - heap to manage information

# Max heap: is a complete binary tree in which the value of a node is greater
# than or equal to the values of its children. Max Heap data structure is useful
# for sorting data using heap sort. A[Parent[i]] >= A[i]

# Min heap: is organized in the opposite way. A[Parent[i]] <= A[i]
